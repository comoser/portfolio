## Context

This talk happened at the [Lisbon GenAI community meetup](https://www.meetup.com/lisbon-langchain-meetup-group/), and it was a great opportunity to share our learnings regarding vibe coding and applying it to real world usecases.

## Description

Join me for a chat on vibe coding - a revolutionary approach to software development with AI assistance.

I'll share real-world experiences from building an **ecommerce store** and **presentation creation tools** using vibe coding principles. We'll explore the **limitations** - challenges with complex business logic and code quality at scale - alongside the compelling **advantages** like 3-5x productivity gains and rapid prototyping capabilities.

Looking toward **the future**, vibe coding represents a fundamental shift in development, requiring the right balance between AI efficiency and human expertise. This talk offers practical insights for developers navigating this rapidly evolving landscape.
