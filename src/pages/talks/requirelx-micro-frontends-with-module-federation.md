## Context

This talk happened at the [Require('lx') meetup](https://www.meetup.com/require-lx/) remotely, but the group is active in Lisbon.

## Description

A talk on a new architecture for frontends using Webpack 5 and Module Federation.
The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/comoser/clothes-store-micro-frontends) demos the potential regarding the solution and I wrote two articles explaining the rationale behind it + the solution designed:

1. [Micro-Frontends at Scale (Part 1)](https://davidalecrim.dev/articles/micro-frontends-at-scale-part-1)
2. [Micro-Frontends at Scale (Part 2)](https://davidalecrim.dev/articles/micro-frontends-at-scale-part-2)
